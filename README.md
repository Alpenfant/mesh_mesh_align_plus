# Mesh Align Plus (Blender Addon)
Mesh Align Plus helps you move things around, precisely: arrange objects in your scene, align mesh parts to each other while you're modeling, and create complex custom transformations using measurements from your models.

In short: You choose from a basic set of operations, pick reference points, and apply custom transformations to a variety of targets. Flexible reference picking and a depth of customization enable sophisticated results.

Some concrete examples of things you can do with the addon:
* Grab an edge, then rotate an object around it
* Stick a flat surface from one object against a flat surface on another object
* Align something to an invisible axis, or shift that axis to a new location first and then rotate around it.

See the simple demo clips below for a general sense of what the addon can do, or watch the full 30 minute demo video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebEkfAQ4OOk">YouTube (Link)</a>.
