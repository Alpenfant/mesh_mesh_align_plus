# Mesh Align Plus (Blender Addon)
Mesh Align Plus helps you move things around, precisely: arrange objects in your scene, align mesh parts to each other while you're modeling, and create complex custom transformations using measurements from your models.

In short: you choose from a basic set of operations, pick reference points, and apply custom transformations to a variety of targets. Flexible reference picking and a depth of customization enable sophisticated results.

For example: Grab an edge, then rotate an object around it. Or, stick a flat surface from one object against a flat surface on another object. Measure the rotational difference between two edges, then rotate a mesh piece to match that angle on a completely unrelated object. Align something to an invisible axis, or shift that axis to a new location first and then rotate around it.
