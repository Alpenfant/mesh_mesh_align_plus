# Mesh Align Plus (Blender Addon)
Mesh Align Plus is a precision modeling addon that lets you move mesh parts and objects around, by picking points of interest and using them as targets for alignments, rotations and other types of transformations.

For example: rest a plane against the tips of three separate pyramid objects...or select an edge and rotate part of your mesh around it (or even take that axis and shift it to a new location, then rotate from there).

The complete manual/wiki is here currently (visit for more info, including contact information): https://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.6/Py/Scripts/Modeling/Mesh_Align_Plus

See the simple demo clips below for a general sense of what the addon can do, or watch the full 30 minute demo video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebEkfAQ4OOk">YouTube (Link)</a>.
